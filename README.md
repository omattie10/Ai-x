# Ai-x
a test to see how far i can push AI to making a website, feel free to steal any code or modify it as most of it wont be mine.

# Main Goal
The goal for this project is to have a functioning website that can assist in day to day use. This could be from an iron man jarvis like system or a simple calendar which tracks your progress.
To make this fun it has to meet the following requirements:
- user friendly UI
- some form of functionality in day to day use
- a website i would use myself
- preferably hosted (it'd be ironic if i hosted it on github so i might aswell host it there)
- customisable



# But why?
With the release of ChatGPT-4 and other AI it's only a matter of time before AI is used in the creation of professional websites, my goal here is to see if there is a difference between what AI can generate and what the human mind can generate in terms of HTML and CSS.
